## About

**Desapeguitos** is a mobile application designed to help parents and families exchange, sell, or donate items their children no longer need. The app allows users to create listings for various items such as baby clothes, toys, furniture, and accessories, making it easier to find new homes for gently used products. Users can filter items by distance and item category, such as **diapers, clothes, furniture, or toys**, and they can choose between **selling, swapping**, or **donating** items.

The app's key features include:
- Creating ads with photos and descriptions.
- Searching by category, item type, or location.
- Filtering options to view items for sale, trade, or donation.
- An intuitive interface with geolocation to show items close to you.
